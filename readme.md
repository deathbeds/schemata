`schemata` is trait system for Python and IPytohn applications that provide:

* validation with jsonschema conventions
* testing strategies `hypothesis`
* user interfaces
    * ansi with `rich`
    * a port of the react json schema form ui-schema to `ipywidgets`
* observable pattern trait patterns

`schemata`'s type system is composable and expresses the type annotations in the form of json schema. attaching the schema to the types allows different interfaces to construct defaults in aspects like testing, visualization, and verification.
